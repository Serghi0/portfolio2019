          I am an island guy born on the Dutch 
            Caribbean Island Curaçao and currently living 
            in The Netherlands. I was brought up with a 
            lot of creativity in the house, whether it was 
            drawing, digital art or music. I started 
            designing and developing websites as a hobby 
            since I was 15 years old.

            Front-end developing is a continuous cycle of 
            learning where patterns that might have been 
            popular a week ago could all of a sudden be 
            out of fashion. That’s why my goal is to 
            continue developing my skills in designing and 
            developing on the front-end.

                For the school subject, European Project Semester, the objective was to 
                create a product for social good. The product had to help informal caregivers 
                help take care of their elders. For this product a mobile app and a web app 
                had to be created. The web app is created with the informal caregiver in 
                mind while the mobile app is intended for the elder. A landing page was 
                needed for the web app. Furthermore, the user will encounter a dashboard 
                with all their user data on this product when they sign in to their account.

              <p>
                  For the school subject, IxD & Technology II, the objective was to create a 
                  website for passengers on a SpaceX spacecraft where they could see the time 
                  on earth wherever they are. The tasks were to indicate on the screen if it was 
                  day time or night time and to show the time in one or more time zones. The 
                  target was also to use the TweenMax library to create animations on the 
                  website. The concept of the design was a rocket flying from earth to mars 
                  where the “space” would indicate what time of the day it is. It will be dark 
                  when it’s at night, it will be sky blue if it is day time and it would be orange if it 
                  is dusk or dawn. Furthermore, the time of the clock determines the 
                  background color. You can also choose different time-zones to see on the 
                  clock.

            <p>
                For the school subject, IxD & Technology I, the objective was to create a timeline website highlighting the history of responsive design. The tasks were to use CSS flex-boxes to create the layout of the timeline. Furthermore, the website had to be mobile-first developed. The concept of the design was a vertical timeline on the desktop website where the timeline text and images would alternate positions on even- and uneven timeline items. The mobile website also has a vertical timeline design, but the timeline text and images don’t alternate.
