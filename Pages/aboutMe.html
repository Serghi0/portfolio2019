      I am an island guy born on the Dutch Caribbean Island Cura&#231;ao and currently living in The Netherlands. 
      I was brought up with a lot of creativity in the house, whether it was drawing, digital art or music. I started designing and developing websites as a hobby since I was 15 years old.

        Front-end developing is a continuous cycle of learning where patterns that might have been popular a week ago could all of a sudden be out of fashion. That's why my goal is to continue developing my skills in designing and developing on the front-end.

         <p>I would like to say that I am on an advanced to expert level on HTML. I know how to apply the content to the pages and how to organize the content correctly.</p>
         <p>The same goes for CSS. I consider myself on an advanced to expert level since I know most of the basic and expert CSS techniques needed to stylize the website. There are still CSS techniques out there that I still need to learn but I am eager to do so!</p>
         <p>For JavaScript I consider myself from an intermediate to advanced level. I know the basic- and some advanced JavaScript techniques but there is still more that I need to learn before I can say that I am an expert. Furthermore, I have barely any experience with jQuery.</p>

            My goal initially was to be a doctor. I quickly found out that it just was not for me. The medical classes that I followed did not get me interested at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a while I decided to try my hands on software engineering since you get to create software and that seemed fun at the time. I quickly realized that even though you can develop things, you don't necessarily get the creative freedom that you get.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is when I learned about the course &quot;Communication &amp; Multimedia Design&quot;. A course that teaches you how to utilize your creativity while being able to develop as well. You also learn valuable research and communication skills. From there on after learning what I can do, I realized that Front-end developing was what I wanted to do.
