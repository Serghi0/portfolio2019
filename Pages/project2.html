        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
          For the school subject, IxD &amp; Technology I, the objective was to create a timeline website highlighting the history of responsive design. The tasks were to use CSS flexboxes to create the layout of the timeline. Furthermore, the website had to be mobile-first developed.
          The concept of the design was a vertical timeline on the desktop website where the timeline text and images would alternate positions on even- and uneven timeline items. The mobile website also has a vertical timeline design, but the timeline text and images don't alternate.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a solo project where I worked solely on the designs and front-end development of the website. I had to do research beforehand on responsive design and the historical facts of responsive design. I also had to do research on how to apply CSS flexbox to the website.

        <h2>Design and front-end development of the website</h2>
        <p>
           This website's designs were created using Lo-Fi prototypes where sketches were made to visualize how the page would look and which elements needed to be added. Furthermore, Hi-Fi prototypes were created to visualize the animations and interactions of the website.
          For the development, HTML was used to apply the content to the website. Additionally, CSS was applied to the website to create the layout of the website. The layout was created mobile first where media queries were used. The layout was created using CSS Flexbox. Furthermore, JavaScript was used to alternate the background images to the item on the screen.

        <h2>Highlighted elements</h2>
        <p>
          What I'm most proud of this project, is the mobile-first responsive design. The implementation of the media queries made it possible to make the website unique for each device. I had no experience with applying mobile-first responsive design, so this was a huge accomplishment. Furthermore, I can apply these codes to new and old projects to make them responsive. 
          I am also proud of the CSS flexbox implementation. This made it easy to place the timeline items on the timeline.
