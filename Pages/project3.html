        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
          For the school subject, European Project Semester, the objective was to create a product for social good. The product had to help informal caregivers help take care of their elders. For this product a mobile app and a web app had to be created. The web app is created with the informal caregiver in mind while the mobile app is intended for the elder. A landing page was needed for the web app. Furthermore, the user will encounter a dashboard with all their user data on this product when they sign in to their account.
        </p>
        <p>This was a group project in a team of seven individuals with different talents. There were five back-end developers, one communication expert and one front-end developer, which was me. My role in this project was as user researcher, lead designer for the mobile- and web app and front-end developer. I was responsible for creating the prototypes for both the mobile- and the web application. I was also responsible for coding the front-end of the web application. Before doing the designing and developing, the group did research together on the target audience, the context and the tools needed to successfully create this product.

        <h2>Design and front-end development of the website</h2>
        <p>
           This website's designs were created using Lo-Fi prototypes where sketches were made to visualize how the page would look and which elements needed to be added. Furthermore, Hi-Fi prototypes were created to visualize the animations and interactions of the website.
          For the development, HTML was used to apply the content to the website. Additionally, CSS was applied to the website to create the layout of the website. The layout was created mobile first where media queries were used. The layout was created using CSS grid layout and CSS Flexbox. Furthermore, JavaScript was used for the form validations and other interactions on the website.

        <h2>Highlighted elements</h2>
        <p>
          What I'm most proud of this project, is the form validation that has been applied to the website. The validation is applied to the majority of the fields and it covers all the possible errors that can be made. I am proud of this because the form validation took a long time to successfully get working. Due to me successfully applying it to this project, I can now re-use the code for other projects in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also proud of the CSS flexbox and CSS Grid layout implementation. This made it easy to place the items on the website so the layout could be made easily.
